    "summary": "The document advocates for the implementation of artificial intelligence education in K-12 school systems, highlighting its rapid market growth and historical context. It argues that AI can significantly reduce teacher workload and improve efficiency through tools for lesson planning, grading (e.g., Gradescope), and personalized instruction (e.g., MATHia). Furthermore, AI can enhance student learning by providing personalized support, aiding brainstorming, and improving research and writing skills. While acknowledging concerns about AI inaccuracies and bias, the document suggests mitigation through critical thinking and effective prompting. It concludes by urging individuals and organizations to advocate for AI integration, asserting that resistance parallels past skepticism towards calculators and hinders progress in education.",
